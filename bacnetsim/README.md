## BACnet (Building Automation and Control Networks) Device & Gateway Simulator

BACnet is an open protocol that enables seamless communication between devices from various manufacturers, facilitating centralized monitoring and control of building systems. Its applications range from small-scale projects like smart homes to large-scale deployments such as smart cities.

Common Use Cases:
*   **HVAC Systems:** Monitoring and controlling temperature, humidity, airflow, and energy consumption.
*   **Lighting Control:** Automating lighting schedules and implementing occupancy-based control.
*   **Security Systems:** Optimizing access control, surveillance, and alarm systems.
*   **And many other applications.**

This project provides a simple BACnet device simulator implemented using threaded and asynchronous approaches, along with an example featuring a BACnet gateway. The repository contains three distinct implementations:

1.  **Simulating BACnet Devices**
3.  **Simulating BACnet Gateway and Devices**

You can easily dockerize and run these implementations using Docker Compose if needed.
